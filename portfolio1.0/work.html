            <p class="description description-left">For the Advance Web Development Course, at Washtenaw Community College. Students were asked to recreate a website that utilized Bootstrap, JavaScript/jQuery, and clean UI. Waxom was originally a Wordpress Theme. It took about 50 days to recreate the one-page website. Skills acquired included UI design and the proper combination of imagery and text. Which allowed for the successful creation of a beautiful yet complex site. I was also able to utilize my newly learned JavaScript skills to create interesting interactions that the everyday user would react to.</p>

            <p class="description description-right">Taylor-Made is a unique company specializing in gift creations and event planning. Located in Baltimore, Maryland. The client wanted a clean yet colorful logo that can be utilized on multiple social media platforms. The client also wanted business collateral to provide a professional image to their customers. This was my first time creating a brand design and logo from the ground up. Usually, I am provided a logo and some prior work to update. This process was exciting from organizing a design brief to the creation of the perfect look for their company.</p>

In this field, I was able to improve my skills not just technical but on the business side as well.
